# SCA model system

## It's a Weight model system based on SCA algorithm
that uses the SCA algorithm to optimize the weight model built on the training data to diagnose example types



## Features

* Apply to data with weak connection between eigenvalues
* Train different numbers of times on different data and compare models


## Build and run

### NEED

* python-flask
* bootstarp


### Run

Run from web_test.py file

### model

Select the data to be trained. The model file will be saved in the model folder and the corresponding normalized file will be generated in /standard/.


### test

You can use the trained model to diagnose individual data, and the results will be presented with the possible probability of negative and positive
